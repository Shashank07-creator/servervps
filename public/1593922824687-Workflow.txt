The idea is to reduce the use of paper using digitizing the process of filing of a form.
To do this we develop a mobile/web application which allows the user to fill up a form by entering the details for the
text fields provided.
The system then converts it into simple text (or JSON) format which will then be converted into a QR Code.
After generation of this QR Code, the code can simply be shown at the counter where it will be scanned using a
camera device.
Upon scanning, the computer will get all the required information from the user and can then manipulate it accordingly.
